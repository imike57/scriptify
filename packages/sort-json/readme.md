# @scriptify-vscode/sort-json

This script is designed to be used with the VS Code extension ["Scriptify"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scriptify.scriptify). It allows you to sort a JSON object in depth, taking into account data types and preserving the order of properties for objects.

## Example

1. Provide a JSON object as input.
2. Use the `sortJSON` script to sort the JSON.
3. The function will recursively sort the object and its nested properties based on their data types.
4. For arrays, the elements will be sorted accordingly.
5. The resulting sorted JSON object will be returned.
