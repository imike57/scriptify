# @scriptify-vscode/lodash


This script is designed to be used with the VS Code extension ["Scriptify"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scriptify.scriptify). It allows you to run Lodash functions interactively and provides a quick way to enter parameters for the selected function.


## Example

1. Open a file in your VS Code editor.
2. Select the value you want to transform.
3. Run the script using the "Scriptify" extension.
4. A quick pick menu will appear with a list of available Lodash functions.
5. Select a function from the list.
6. For each function parameter, enter the corresponding value when prompted.
   - The first parameter will be pre-populated with the selected value from step 2.
7. The script will execute the selected Lodash function with the provided parameters.
8. The result will be displayed in the VS Code output channel.

**Note:** Make sure to provide valid input values that match the expected parameter types of the selected Lodash function. Unexpected input types may lead to errors or unexpected results.
